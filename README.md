You can capture your pic with live croping manually.

You have to run the code and wait for the webcam to be open.
Then you can click at two different positions having some rectangular area.
you will get a cropped image of that area in your loacl directory.

This software is under development, and will contain some more advanced features like multi shape cropping and many more with the time in future.
